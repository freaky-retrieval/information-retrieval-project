  "description": "Whether you’re an avid traveler, social influencer, nostalgic scrapbooker or on-the-go photographer, one thing is certain—printing pictures takes too many steps! Now, with the KODAK step printer, printing full-color photographs is faster and easier than ever. Just pair with any Bluetooth- or NFC-enabled smart device, and stunning full-color photo prints are in your hand in under 60 seconds. Zink Zero Ink technology eliminates the need for expensive inks, toners and ribbons, delivering cool 2”x3” photographs you can peel and stick to any surface. Photos come out clear, bright, colorful and covered with an extra layer of protective coating to prevent smudges, rips and water damage. The KODAK app also lets you customize photos far beyond the usual ‘flip’ and ‘rotate’ of your smartphone. Use our extensive editing tools to apply flattering filters, cutesy stickers, decorative frames and other personalized flair. Note - *To ensure the best possible photo quality, make sure to properly insert the photo paper into the printer. Always load the blue Quality Card from the same pack of photo paper that is in the printer. The blue card should be inserted into the paper tray with the barcode facing down. If you use a blue card from other packs of paper, you might not get the best results. *If you are experiencing a paper jam, make sure to turn the printer off and on again. This should eject the paper out. Do not pull out the paper by hand. *Make sure not to cover the printing slot with your hand when the photo is printing.",

    "rawText": "From the manufacturer\n\nWhat is a Megatank? \n· An inkjet printer that uses a continuous ink supply system to deliver sustainable, high quality, cost-effective prints. \n· Design to last as long as 30 conventional ink cartridge sets.(2) \n· Can print up to 6,000 x 3 crisp black pages / 7,000 magnificent color pages.(1) \nRETHINK THE WAY YOU PRINT WITH CONTINUOUS INK \nWireless - Print l Copy l Scan \nIntroducing the Canon PIXMA G3200/G3202 Wireless MegaTank All-In-One Printer–the perfect printer for people who print a lot and copy a lot. The MegaTank ink reservoir system allows it to print up to 6,000 crisp black pages / 7,000 magnificent color pages(1) from one set of replacement inks bottles. Plus, you can print on the go with your compatible mobile device. \nIntegrated Ink Tanks \nPrint cartridge free and easily keep tabs on ink levels with front mounted reservoirs. \nCost-Effective Printing \nPrint up to 6,000 crisp black pages / 7,000 magnificent color pages(1). That’s equivalent to 30 standard ink cartridges!(2) \nEasy-To-Refill \nBe mess free with the Megatank’s ink bottles. Simply screw off the cap and squeeze the bottle to pour the ink into the tank. \nDocument & Borderless Photo Printing \nEnjoy the increase in print volume without sacrificing high-quality document & borderless photo prints. Print text-heavy documents to family photos using rich sharp blacks and bright, vivid colors. \nSharp Black Text \nPrint detailed documents with Sharp Black Text from the pigment black ink. \nBorderless Photos \nPrint beautiful Borderless Photos(6) in (4”x6”, 5”x5”, 5”x7”, 8”x10”, 8.5”x11”) \nPrint on-the-go \nPrint using the Canon PRINT app and more. \nBuilt in Wi-Fi(R) \nPrint from any room in the house with Built In WI-FI(3). \n1. Page yield of included ink bottles used for initial setup is lower than the replacement ink bottles, as a certain amount of ink is consumed to fill into the print head during the setup (charging the print head initially). Page yield is the estimated value based on Canon individual test method using the ISO/IEC 24712 chart and continuous printing simulation with the replacement ink bottles after initial setup. Page yield of color inks is an average yield of cyan, magenta and yellow inks combined. Page yield varies significantly depending on content printed and other factors. Up to 6,000 (black) / 7,000 (color) printed page yields are approximate, based off document pages printed. \n2. 30 ink cartridge sets is based on print yield of the included black and color ink bottles as compared to the following standard-capacity cartridge sets: PG-245 Black Ink Cartridge and CL-246 Color Ink Cartridge as of August 2016. \n3. Wireless printing and scanning requires a working network with wireless 802.11b/g or n capability. Wireless performance may vary based on terrain and distance between the printer and wireless network clients. \n4. Requires an Internet Connection. \n5. Requires an Internet connection and the Canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY app, available for free on the App Store and at Google Play. Compatible with iPad, iPhone 3GS or later, and iPod touch 3rd generation or later devices running iOS 7.0 or later, and AndroidTM mobile devices running Android 2.3.3 or later. Your device must be connected to the same working network with wireless 802.11 b/g/n capability as your printer. Requires an compatible social media account and is subject to that social media account’s Terms of Service. Certain exceptions may apply. \n6. Requires an Internet connection and Google account. Subject to Google Terms of Service. Certain exceptions may apply. \n7. AirPrint functionality requires an iPad, iPhone 3GS or later, or iPod touch 3rd generation or later device running iOS 4.2 or later, and an AirPrint-enabled printer connected to the same network as your iOS device. \n8. Requires AndroidTM mobile device with AndroidTM 4.4 operating system or later with the Mopria Print Service pre-loaded with that device and the compatible PIXMA printer on the same wireless network. The Mopria experience is also available on AndroidTM 4.4 mobile devices with a download of the Mopria Print Service from Google Play. \n9. Document print speeds are the averages of ESAT in Office Category Test for the default simplex mode, ISO/IEC 24734. Photo print speed is based on the default setting using ISO/JIS-SCID N2 on Photo Paper Plus Glossy II and does not take into account data processing time on host computer. Print speed may vary depending on system configuration, interface, software, document complexity, print mode, page coverage, type of paper used etc. Copy speeds are the average of sFCOT and sESAT, ISO/IEC 29183. Copy speed may vary depending on document complexity, copy mode, page coverage, type of paper used etc. and does not take into account warming up time. See the Canon website for additional details.",

  "description": "The EcoTank Photo ET-8500 wireless all-in-one prints lab-quality color photos, graphics and everyday documents — all at an incredible value. Epson’s cartridge-free, 6-color Claria ET Premium Ink system delivers vibrant colors and sharp text for all your creative projects. With low-cost replacement ink bottles, print 4\" x 6\" photos for about 4 cents each compared to 40 cents with cartridges (1). Print everything from borderless 8.5\" x 11\" photos to customized CDs/DVDs. You can even print on cardstock and other media up to 1.3 mm thick. For added convenience, each set of bottles lets you print for up to 2 years (2). Plus, save up to 80 percent with replacement ink bottles vs. ink cartridges (3) — that’s about $2,000 on each set (3). The EcoTank Photo lets you do it all with affordable in-house printing. 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO 29103 page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of June 2020. 2. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 200 pages. 3. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO 24712 page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of June 2020. 4. Color photo in Draft Mode on Premium Photo Paper Glossy measured from start of paper feed. Actual print times will vary based on factors including system configuration, software, and page complexity. For more information. 5. Replacement ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Replacement ink bottle photo yields are significantly lower and are based on the ISO/IEC 29103 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information. 6. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of a replacement set of Black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of June 2020. 7. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps. 8. Epson Smart Panel App download required. Data usage fees may apply. 9. Epson Connect account and voice-activated account registration required. See for device compatibility.  10. 12 months of standard limited warranty or 50,000 plain paper sheets (whichever happens first). For an additional 12-month extended service plan (total of 24 months or 50,000 plain paper sheets, whichever happens first), register your product and use Epson genuine ink bottles. See Limited Warranty for details. 11. For convenient and reasonable recycling options. 12. SmartWay is an innovative partnership of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that reduces greenhouse gases and other air pollutants and improves fuel efficiency.",

  "description": "You’re looking for an easy-to-use Supertank printer that will get the job done. That’s why we developed the EcoTank ET-2400 – an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you’ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-2400 features genuine Epson print quality and a high-resolution flatbed scanner – making it a convenient choice for essential, everyday home printing.  Epson strongly recommends the use of genuine ink to ensure optimal print quality and performance. Use of non-genuine ink could cause damage not covered under the printer’s limited warranty. | 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of March 2024. | 2. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of an included or replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of March 2024. | 3. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 125 pages. | 5. See www.epson.com/voice for device compatibility. Epson Connect account and voice-activated account registration required. | 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit www.epson.com/connect | 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel app download. Data usage fees may apply.",

  "description": "Your family needs a printer that’s fast, affordable, and easy to use. That’s why we developed the EcoTank ET-2800 – an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you’ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-2800 features genuine Epson print quality, a high-resolution flatbed scanner, and convenient color display – making it the ideal basic home printer.  Epson strongly recommends the use of genuine ink to ensure optimal print quality and performance. Use of non-genuine ink could cause damage not covered under the printer’s ltd. wnty. | 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of March 2024. | 2. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of an included or replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of March 2024. | 3. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 125 pages. | 5. See www.epson.com/voice for device compatibility. Epson Connect™ account and voice-activated account registration required. | 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit www.epson.com/connect | 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel app download. Data usage fees may apply.",

  "description": "Your home needs a printer that’s fast, affordable, easy to use, and has great features. That’s why we developed the EcoTank ET-2850 – an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you’ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-2850 features outstanding print quality, auto-duplex printing, a high-resolution flatbed scanner, and convenient color display – making it the perfect family printer.  Epson strongly recommends the use of genuine ink to ensure optimal print quality and performance. Use of non-genuine ink could cause damage not covered under the printer’s ltd. wnty. | 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of March 2024. | 2. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of an included or replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of March 2024. | 3. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 150 pages. | 5. See www.epson.com/voice for device compatibility. Epson Connect account and voice-activated account registration required. | 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit www.epson.com/connect | 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel app download. Data usage fees may apply.",

  "description": "Your busy home needs a printer that’s fast, affordable, easy to use, and has premium features. That’s why we developed the EcoTank ET-3830 – an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you’ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-3830 features fast printing with outstanding print quality, productive paper handling, a high-resolution flatbed scanner, and a large color display – making it the perfect printer for productive families.  Epson strongly recommends the use of genuine ink to ensure optimal print quality and performance. Use of non-genuine ink could cause damage not covered under the printer’s ltd. wnty. | 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of March 2024. | 2. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of an included or replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of March 2024. | 3. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 200 pages. | 5. See www.epson.com/voice for device compatibility. Epson Connect™ account and voice-activated account registration required. | 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit www.epson.com/connect | 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel app download. Data usage fees may apply.",

  "description": "Your home office needs a printer that’s fast, affordable, and easy to use. That’s why we developed the EcoTank ET-4800 – an innovative cartridge-free solution that uses high-capacity, easily refillable ink tanks. So you’ll worry less about running out of ink, and save a lot on replacement ink (1). The ET-4800 features genuine Epson print quality, an auto document feeder, fax, a high-resolution flatbed scanner, and convenient color display – making it the perfect basic home office printer.  Epson strongly recommends the use of genuine ink to ensure optimal print quality and performance. Use of non-genuine ink could cause damage not covered under the printer’s ltd. wnty. | 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of March 2024. | 2. Individual cartridges estimate based on print yields of an included or replacement set of black and color ink bottles as compared to Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured printers as of March 2024. | 3. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity. Yields may be lower when printing infrequently or predominantly with one ink color. All ink colors are used for printing and printer maintenance, and all colors must be available for printing. For more information, visit www.epson.com/inkinfo | 4. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 125 pages. | 5. See www.epson.com/voice for device compatibility. Epson Connect account and voice-activated account registration required. | 6. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, visit www.epson.com/connect | 7. Requires Epson Smart Panel app download. Data usage fees may apply.",

  "description": "The EcoTank ET-15000 wireless all-in-one offers Cartridge-Free Printing with easy-to-fill supersized ink tanks. Save up to 90 percent on ink with low-cost replacement bottles — as little as 1 cent per color ISO page vs. 20 cents with ink cartridges (1). This all-in-one delivers vibrant prints up to 13\" x 19\" (through rear-feed tray) and scans up to 8. 5\" x 14\" (via the ADF). Print for up to 2 years with each included or replacement ink bottle set (2) — each replacement set includes enough ink to print up to 6, 000 pages (3). That’s equivalent to about 80 individual cartridges (4). And, there’s zero cartridge waste. The ET-15000 features a 250-sheet front tray paper capacity and rear specialty-paper feed, plus a 2. 7\" color touchscreen and hands-free voice-activated printing (5). *The NPD Group, , Total Channel Tracking Service, U. S. & Canada, Inkjet SF/MF Printers, Refillable ink tank included, based on units, February 2019 - January 2020. Supertank printers are defined as refillable ink tank printers. 1. Actual savings and costs will vary considerably based on print tasks, print volumes and usage conditions. Savings and cost per ISO page are based on the cost of replacement ink bottles and the cost of enough standard cartridges to achieve the total page yields of the bottles using the MSRP (USD) and yields for Epson standard-capacity ink cartridges for similarly featured Epson consumer inkjet printers as of February 2019. 2. Based on average monthly document print volumes of about 200 pages. 3. Part of the ink from the included bottles is used for initial setup; yields are lower than those of replacement ink bottles. Replacement and included ink bottle yields based on the ISO/IEC 24712 pattern with Epson’s methodology. Actual ink yields will vary considerably for reasons including images printed, print settings, temperature and humidity.

  "description": "The photographic print defines the true art of photography. As the canvas is to a painter, the print allows you to clearly portray every detail of your creative vision — and for all to experience what you felt at the moment of capture. Introducing the SureColor P700 — a breakthrough in professional printing technology. Drawing from over 20 years of experience, the SureColor P700 incorporate the same large-format printing technology used by the world’s leading photographers into a sleek, compact design, allowing for the creation of exhibition quality prints from the convenience of a desktop. This product uses only genuine Epson-brand cartridges. Other brands of ink cartridges and ink supplies are not compatible and, even if described as compatible, may not function properly or at all.1. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, 2. Roll media handling is standard on P700; optional on P900.3. Print Permanence in testing. WIR lightfastness ratings are based on accelerated testing of prints on specified media, displayed indoors, under glass. Actual print stability will vary according to media, printed image, display conditions, light intensity, humidity and atmospheric conditions. Epson does not guarantee longevity of prints. For maximum print life, display all prints under glass or UV-absorbing acrylic and protect them from prolonged high-humidity environments. 4. For convenient and reasonable recycling options. SmartWay is an innovative partnership of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that reduces greenhouse gases and other air pollutants and improves fuel efficiency.",

    "Easy printing from smart devices — print color-managed files directly from your iOS device (1) using an easy-to-use interface",
    "New Carbon Black Driver Technology — all-new Carbon Black Driver mode dramatically increases Dmax for best-in-class black density on glossy papers",
    "Professional media handling — accommodates rolls (2) and sheet media up to 1.5 mm thick of Epson Professional, Signature Worthy and Legacy papers as well as third-party media",

  "description": "Unleash your inner bold and bloom-tiful creativity with the Brother Sublimation Printer. The Brother Sublimation Printer is ideal for any maker, artist, or designer as it allows you to create vibrant color projects such as tee shirts, tote bags, ceramic mugs, metal tumblers, coasters and more using Artspira*, Brother’s editing and design app. Once you design in Artspira*, you can quickly transfer your creations to your Brother Sublimation Printer and print high-quality, vibrant color designs. How does sublimation printing work? Sublimation printing prints your graphic onto a sheet of sublimation paper. Then, you use a heat press to transfer the design from the paper onto your product. Dye sublimation printing is a technique that uses heat to transfer images onto sublimation surfaces like shirts, hats, jackets, awards, mugs, mousepads, home decor, tumblers, and coasters (for best results, use materials that have polyester, or a polymer coating. Try to avoid natural fibers and materials/fabrics). Create custom projects for birthdays, celebrations, and inviting home decor. With the Brother Sublimation Printer, your imagination, and Artspira*, creating personalized pieces in vibrant color with exceptional print quality is fun. To start using the Brother Sublimation Printer, first download the Artspira app*. Downloading and setting up Artspira is easy! Access the app store, download the app, create an account, and connect your machine. Once in the Artspira app, you can access over 100 sublimation designs, stylistic photo authentic images, and more!

  "description": "The photographic print defines the true art of photography. As the canvas is to a painter, the print allows you to clearly portray every detail of your creative vision — and for all to experience what you felt at the moment of capture. Introducing the SureColor P900 — a breakthrough in professional printing technology. Drawing from over 20 years of experience, the SureColor P900 incorporate the same large-format printing technology used by the world’s leading photographers into a sleek, compact design, allowing for the creation of exhibition quality prints from the convenience of a desktop. This product uses only genuine Epson-brand cartridges. Other brands of ink cartridges and ink supplies are not compatible and, even if described as compatible, may not function properly or at all.1. Most features require an Internet connection to the printer, as well as an Internet- and/or email-enabled device. For a list of Epson Connect enabled printers and compatible devices and apps, 2. Roll media handling is standard on P700; optional on P900.3. Print Permanence in testing. WIR lightfastness ratings are based on accelerated testing of prints on specified media, displayed indoors, under glass. Actual print stability will vary according to media, printed image, display conditions, light intensity, humidity and atmospheric conditions. Epson does not guarantee longevity of prints. For maximum print life, display all prints under glass or UV-absorbing acrylic and protect them from prolonged high-humidity environments. 4.",

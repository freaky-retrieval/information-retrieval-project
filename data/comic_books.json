  "bookDescription": "Watchmen, the groundbreaking series from award-winning author Alan Moore, presents a world where the mere presence of American superheroes changed history--the U.S. won the Vietnam War, Nixon is still president, and the Cold War is in full effect.Considered the greatest graphic novel in the history of the medium, the Hugo Award-winning story chronicles the fall from grace of a group of superheroes plagued by all-too-human failings. Along the way, the concept of the superhero is dissected as an unknown assassin stalks the erstwhile heroes.This edition of Watchmen, the groundbreaking series from Alan Moore, the award-winning author of V For Vendetta and Batman: The Killing Joke, features art from industry legend Dave Gibbons, with high-quality, recolored pages found in Watchmen: Absolute Edition.",

  "bookDescription": "In 1986, Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli produced this groundbreaking reinterpretation of the origin of Batman—who he is, and how he came to be. Sometimes careless and naive, this Dark Knight is far from the flawless vigilante he is today. In his first year on the job, Batman feels his way around a Gotham City far darker than the one he left. His solemn vow to extinguish the town’s criminal element is only half the battle; along with Lieutenant James Gordon, the Dark Knight must also fight a police force more corrupt than the scum in the streets.Batman: Year One stands next to Batman: The Dark Knight Returns on the mantle of greatest Batman graphic novels of all time. Timeless in its appeal, Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli’s masterpiece would stand apart from the crowded comics field even today.This edition includes the complete graphic novel, a new introduction by writer Frank Miller and a new illustrated afterword by artist David Mazzucchelli. Completing this collection are over 40 pages of never-before-seen developmental material such as character and layout sketches, sample script pages, sketches, and more that pro-vide a glimpse into the making of this contemporary classic.This volume collects Batman #404-407.",

  "bookDescription": "RETURN TO THE RONIN-VERSE! In the smash-hit miniseries The Last Ronin, readers were taken on a pulse-pounding trek through time—past, present, future—to witness the final gut-wrenching days of the Heroes in a Half Shell. For Michelangelo in particular, the march to his heartbreaking last battle was long and dangerous, taking him from New York City, to Japan, across Asia and Europe, and then back home again to administer final justice against those guilty of killing his family. But what happened during those fateful years when he had only the need for vengeance and Master Splinter’s journal to guide him? What battles did he fight? What hard lessons did he learn? The time has come to find out as original miniseries writers Kevin Eastman and Tom Waltz join artists Ben Bishop ( The Last Ronin) and SL Gallant (G.I. A Real American Hero) to finally reveal what adventures the Last Ronin experienced during his vengeful journey. While in the present, a new master, Casey Marie Jones, prepares her young terrapin students to be the next generation of…Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles!",

  "bookDescription": "Superstar writer Tom King’s Batman stories are collected in a new format, including “I Am Gotham,” “The Button,” and more!In 2016, DC Rebirth brought new life to the company’s core line of superhero stories. At the forefront was the relaunched flagship Batman series, written by rising star Tom King, who was joined by top-tier artists including David Finch, Mikel Janín, Mitch Gerads, and Jason Fabok.  Now, these stories return in a hefty new collection, including the compelling story arcs “I Am Gotham” “I Am Suicide,” “Rooftops,” “I Am Bane,” and “The Button,” an unexpected crossover with The Flash! And speaking of unexpected… this volume also collects the Batman/Elmer Fudd Special by King and Lee Weeks, a thoroughly unlikely pairing between DC’s Dark Knight and Looney Tunes’ hapless hunter that yielded one of the most gripping noir tales that comics has seen!This volume collects Batman: Rebirth #1, Batman #1-6, #9-22, The Flash #21-22, and Batman/Elmer Fudd Special #1.",

  "bookDescription": "In 1988, Batman readers were allowed to vote on the outcome of the story... and they decided that Robin should die! Jim Starlin's devastating graphic novel classic left shockwaves throughout the comic book industry, many of which are still felt today! As the second person to assume the role of Batman's sidekick, Jason Todd had a completely different personality than the original Robin. Rash and prone to ignore Batman's instructions, Jason was always quick to act without regard to consequences. In this fatal instance, Robin ignores his mentor's warnings when he attempts to take on the Joker by himself and pays the ultimate price. Driven by anger with Superman by his side, Batman seeks his vengeance as he looks to end the Joker's threat forever.This tale of loss, guilt and brutality is considered one of the most defining pieces in the Dark Knight's mythology. Batman: A Death in the Family collects Batman #426-429.",

After decades as Earth's champions, the members of the Justice League have all retreated out of the public eye, replaced with a new generation of crime-fighters whose brand of justice leaves humanity terrified, rather than inspired. But with the planet's future in jeopardy, Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman must come out of retirement to make one last stand for truth and justice...From comics writer Mark Waid and artist Alex Ross comes this definitive collection of the seminal masterpiece Kingdom Come, with more than 100 pages of sketches, annotations and other behind-the-scenes features.",

  "bookDescription": "\"In a world dominated by plenty of corporate comics, this Transformers title is a muscle car built in neighborhood garage.” - The Hollywood Reporter  THE TRANSFORMERS JOIN THE ENERGON UNIVERSE! Optimus Prime was supposed to have led the Autobots to victory. Instead, the fate of Cybertron is unknown, and his allies have crash-landed far from home, alongside their enemies—the Decepticons. As these titanic forces renew their war on Earth, one thing is immediately clear: the planet will never be the same. New alliances are struck. Battle lines are redrawn. And humanity’s only hope of survival is Optimus Prime.  Superstar creator Daniel Warren Johnson (Do a Powerbomb, Wonder Woman: Dead Earth), alongside showrunner Robert Kirkman (The Walking Dead, Invincible), reimagines Hasbro’s robots in disguise for a brand-new generation.  Collects TRANSFORMERS #1-6",

  "bookDescription": "PICK UP THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU PICK UP THE MICROPHONEPart instruction manual, part memoir and part cautionary tale, “How to FAIL at Stand-Up Comedy” is a hilarious and sometimes heartbreaking exploration of a 30 year career in stand-up. Sabo pulls no punches while revealing what it’s really like to live the life of a traveling comedian, warts and all. Sabo points out everything you can do wrong in this business with glaring detail and without judgment. Chock full of advice from industry insiders and experts in the field, “FAIL” takes you on the journey from open-miker to seasoned headliner and all the speed bumps in between. You will learn how to get booked into top clubs, how to create perfect promotional material, how to ace an audition, and how to avoid becoming a statistic. You will also learn what jokes NOT to tell, what food to NOT eat at a comedy condo and how careers can be ruined before even picking up the microphone. Sabo doesn’t have his own sitcom or Netflix special; what he does have is a wealth of comedy experience and the scars to prove it. This book is a must read for any aspiring comic, established comedian or fan of stand-up.“Don’t let the title fool you. It’s not about failing to make it as a stand-up comedian. This book is about the experience: learning from your failures, mishaps, surprises and the need to develop a thick skin in order to become successful. Sabo’s writing takes aspiring comedians by the hand and leads them through the ups and downs of what it takes to make a career in this crazy business. This is a view from the comedy trenches.” - Dave Schwensen, author of How To Be A Working Comic and talent coordinator for A&E’s An Evening at the Improv “Steve Sabo literally wrote the book on making mistakes in the comedy business. You name it, he’s effed it up, probably more than once. That’s what makes this book so helpful and entertaining!” –Rob Durham, author of “Don’t Wear Shorts on Stage”",

    "rawText": "Product Description\nIt's Time to Store Your Comics in Style \nGeneric white comic book storage boxes can provide some protection, but they are a total eyesore. You'll want to keep them out of sight and out of mind. Comic Vision is different. It's for collectors who value presentation. This stylish black box will allow you to showcase your passion for comics in a more pronounced and personal way. \n\t\nThe Protection Your Collection Needs \nIt'll help you organize and store your comics in style while providing protection around the clock. Each box is covered in water-resistant PVC, so your comic books will be shielded against spills, leaks, or humidity-related issues. This high level of protection is especially important in areas prone to dampness or unexpected water exposure. \n\t\nCan Hold 150 Comic Books Comfortably \nThe large capacity storage box measures 11 x 15 x 7.5 inches and has enough space for up to 150-200 bagged or boarded comic books. This makes it an ideal choice for both casual readers and serious collectors. Its size strikes the perfect balance between capacity and convenience, easily fitting into most shelves or storage spaces. \n\t\nMarvelous Gift for Comic Book Collectors \nFor anyone who appreciates comics, this storage box is a gift that shows a deep understanding of their hobby, making it much more meaningful and personal than a generic present. Speaking of gifts, a complimentary copy of the 'The Comic Grading Guide' comes included. This guide will help turn you into a comic grading whiz! \n\t\nClear Pocket for Comic Book Display \nSick of the guessing games with standard comic boxes? Ours takes out all the guesswork. It allows you to display a representative comic in the clear pocket on the outside, which will provide a quick reference of what's stored inside - no need to open the box! This will also add some aesthetic appeal to your comic book collection. \n\t\nSturdy, Stackable with Carry Handles \nComic Vision is made with 1500g boards, so it’s super sturdy and stackable. This design keeps your comics well protected from physical damage and maximizes space efficiency - you can stack ‘em sky high! Also, the carry handles make it a breeze to transport your collection, whether for reorganizing, sharing with friends, or moving. \n\t\nRemovable Hook & Loop Fastener Lid \nThe box's flip-top lid detaches and can be attached to the side using the integrated hook-and-loop fasteners. This thoughtful design means there's no need to struggle with placing the lid under a heavy box. Plus, these fasteners aren't just for the lid; they also let you join two boxes side by side, adding extra stability to your storage setup. \n\t\nLabels Conveniently on the Small Side \nWhen boxes are stored with the small side facing out, these labels become easily visible, so locating specific comics or series is a piece of cake.

  "bookDescription": "A New York Times best-seller!In an alternate world where the mere presence of American superheroes changed history, the US won the Vietnam War, Nixon is still president, and the cold war is in full effect!Watchmen begins as a murder-mystery, but soon unfolds into a planet-altering conspiracy. As the resolution comes to a head, the unlikely group of reunited heroes--Rorschach, Nite Owl, Silk Spectre, Dr. Manhattan and Ozymandias--have to test the limits of their convictions and ask themselves where the true line is between good and evil. In the mid-eighties, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons created Watchmen, changing the course of comics' history and essentially remaking how popular culture perceived the genre. Popularly cited as the point where comics came of age, Watchmen's sophisticated take on superheroes has been universally acclaimed for its psychological depth and realism.Watchmen is collected here in deluxe hardcover, with sketches, extra bonus material and a new introduction by series artist Dave Gibbons.",

    "rawText": "Product Description\nHave You Been Treating Your Comic Books With The Love And Care They Deserve? \nIf you haven’t, it's never too late to start. Like all things printed on paper, comic books may not exactly have been historically made to last forever. And as they age, the inks will fade, the wood pulp will degrade, and the pages will become yellowed and extremely brittle. If you want to preserve your comics, you need to shield them from factors that speed up breakdown, like high levels of moisture and UV light. But that doesn't mean you have to lock them up and never see them again! \nThis Comic Book Frame from Komiq will help you show off your prized comics while fending off the elements. \nDurable Frames \nComic book frames made of MDF and plastic may be readily accessible and cheaper to ship. But the lighter weight and thinner density could make them more prone to cracking, warping, or getting damaged in transit. Your frames need to be sturdy and solid if they're meant to house and protect your valued comic book. Available in Black and White, our pine wood frames are clean, smooth, and exquisitely engineered to stand the test of time. \nCrystal Clear Acrylic \nYou’ll find other comic book frames equipped with windows of polycarbonate and glass. But glass shatters easily and will do little to block UV rays, while polycarbonate can be easily chipped and scratched. Instead, we use transparent acrylic panels that are clear, light, and strong. Acrylic is also inherently UV-filtering, which will help protect your comics from quickly yellowing and fading. \nPremium Look & Feel \nNo matter the size of your exhibit, you'll want to give your prized pieces the respect they deserve. Wooden frames will always be classic and timeless — and the quality material will effortlessly blend in any style of home décor, from rustic farmhouse to minimalist and modern interiors. A single issue sitting in this pine wood frame will look just as stunning in a gallery as it will acting as a custom centerpiece for your desk. \nMore Reasons To Choose Our Comic Book Frames! \nPreservation Made Simple \nThe value of a comic book is dependent on its condition. That's why you need to take extra steps to preserve them beyond just putting them behind glass. First, encase your comic book in an archival bag, preferably polyethylene or mylar. Then, lay it flat in the frame against an acid-free board to prevent creasing and crumpling. Finally, seal everything together and mount your setup somewhere nicely dry and away from direct heat and light. \n\t\nVersatile Installation \nMake a mini gallery with a few frames hanging in a hallway or arranged on floating shelves. Each frame is equipped with sturdy sawtooth hangers for effortless installation. More than just for comic books, they can also effectively display photography and traditional art pieces like oil and watercolor paintings, prints, ink, pencil, or pastel pieces. The inside measurements are 7.28”x10.6”x0.39”. \n\t\nMade For Art Lovers, By Art Lovers \nCollecting comic books is a tradition rooted in history, culture, and a genuine love for art. Whether you like superheroes, horror stories, fantasy, or science fiction, there's a comic book out there for everyone. And your collection, no matter how big or small, helps ensure that the art form will transcend the generations. These comic book frames make excellent gifts for budding artists, comic fans, and art collectors of all ages. \n\t\nComic Sizes by Years \nGolden Age \t7 3/4 x 10 1/2 inches (19.7 x 26.7 cm). Comics published in 1943 up to 1960 \t\nSilver Age \t7 1/8 x 10 1/2 inches (18.1 x 26.7 cm).

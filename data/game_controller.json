If it used on the remote control for TV, you may without changing battery for a few years. The energy is so powerful that you can’t imagine it.\nMore economical, free of Lead and Mercury, rechargeable batteries can reduce the harm of regular batteries to the environment.\nConstant voltage output: Kratax 1.5v rechargeable AA battery provide an approximately equal and stable voltage to the device until it runs out of power.\nMulti-protection function: Built-in protection device to prevent Overcharge, Overvoltage, Overcurrent, Over Discharge, Reverse Charge and Short-circuit protection, can protect the battery and charger very good. \nSuitable for all kinds of high-power demand electrical device! \nUp to 3A current output which can be better applied to high current devices.\nSuitable for Xbox Controller, Blink camera, Electric Toys, Remote Controls, Smart home devices, Microphone, Electric shaver, Medical Devices etc. Household and Office Devices. \nFlashlight(The charging current of the flashlight is less than 2A to be used).\n(Not available on Camera Flash, Seiko R-Wave Mantel Clocks and AM Radio)\nQuick Battery Charger \nCharging Time: About 2 hours\nInput: Type-C 5V 2A\nOutput: 500mA*4Ch\nIndependent charging channel\nCharging Voltage: 5V\nRed Indicator --- Charging \nGreen Indicator --- Full charged \n(The blue light at the positive pole of the battery is up when charging, and goes off when the battery is full) \nRed flashing --- Error \n----The charger adopts a high-precision IC control system with battery identification and data reading capabilities. If other types of batteries are mistakenly charged, the charger will issue a flashing red light warning message. \nConstant voltage output 1.5V Lithium-ion battery is a new generation of battery, so this Kratax charger is only suitable for this new type of battery, not for the traditional 3V-3.7V Li-ion battery. \nConstant Voltage Output \nLonger life than normal Alkaline batteries and other rechargeable battery. \nStable outputs voltage from 100% to 0% electric capacity, 1.5V constant voltage output at 100mA discharge, providing constant voltage and best performance in high current and voltage device. \nCost-effective \nCapacity: 3500mWh / 2333mAh \nCharging time than the traditional Ni-MH rechargeable battery saving about half the time. Low self-discharge, is about 0.03% per month, which is less than 1/100 of Ni-MH batteries. The weight is about 19g, is 20% lower than Ni-MH batteries. \nMore Durable \nIt is recommended to use Kratax battery and Kratax charger as a set, not to mix with other brands. \nQUESTIONS \nQ: Can batteries be used for blink cameras? \nA: The battery is suitable for most people's blink cameras, but when the camera runs frequently (such as an object that is constantly moving), the current consumption is too large, it may affect the usage time. \nQ: Lithium-ion batteries and disposable batteries, which lasts longer in the flashlight? \nA: The disposable battery has a long working time, but the lithium-ion battery can be recycled, the overall use time is longer, and the cost performance is higher. \nThe disposable battery can maintain high brightness due to the relatively high voltage during early operation. Then as the voltage decreases, the brightness will become lower and lower until the user replaces the battery. \nThe Lithium-ion battery voltage is constant, so the flashlight can maintain the highest brightness in the setting until the battery stops outputting, so the working time of a single lithium-ion battery will be about half less than that of a disposable battery. \nQ: Why does it feel like a disposable battery discharges more power than a Li-ion battery? \nA: Because the disposable battery does not need to be charged, it can use up all the power. Lithium-ion batteries require a secondary charge of the battery, so some of the power needs to be retained to maintain the battery's activity, So it will feel like the disposable battery releases more power. \nQ: Why do lithium-ion batteries feel a little bigger than alkaline batteries? \nA: The size of our battery is 50.5mm*14.6mm*14.6mm (L*W*H), because the lithium-ion battery is equipped with a protective plate, it may be 0.1~0.2mm larger than the length and diameter of a few alkaline batteries, mainly depends on What product to compare with. \n\t\n\t8 AA batteries&Charger 8pack AA batteries 12pack AA batteries Charger with 8 AA Batteries 4 AA Batteries&Charger 12 AA Batteries&Charger \n\t\nAdd to Cart \nAdd to Cart \nBuying Options \nAdd to Cart \nAdd to Cart \nAdd to Cart \nCustomer Reviews \n4.2 out of 5 stars \n41 \n\t\n4.2 out of 5 stars \n1,586 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n32 \n\t\n4.1 out of 5 stars \n121 \n\t\n4.2 out of 5 stars \n1,586 \n\t\n4.2 out of 5 stars \n1,586 \n\t\nPrice $44.99$44.99 \t$38.99$38.99 \t— \t$47.99$47.99 \t$29.99$29.99 \t$58.99$58.99 \t\nCharging Indicator Charging progress indicator \tN/A \tN/A \tCharging progress indicator \tSimple Indicator \tSimple Indicator \t\nLow Battery Alert YES \tN/A \tN/A \tN/A \tN/A \tN/A \t\nMulti-protection ✓ \t✓ \t✓ \t✓ \t✓ \t✓ \t\nConstant voltage ✓ \t✓ \t✓ \t✓ \t✓ \t✓",

However, some customers have reported issues with the build quality feeling cheap, less reliable internal hardware, and broken controllers after just a few months of use. There are also complaints about buttons malfunctioning or getting stuck inside the housing. Stick drift is also mentioned as a negative aspect. Opinions differ on overall functionality and controller quality.",

The battery should last around 19 hours with normal use. The Envision does not have a battery and does not need one. It only runs off of direct power from the PC to the controller via USB-C. \nCan I use thumbstick toppers with SCUF Envision? \nYes, you can use Thumbstick Grips Tactic, Thumbstick Grips Catalyst, Thumbstick Grips Pulse. \nWhat are the thumbstick sizes for SCUF Envision? \nWe offer different thumbstick sizes: \nShort Concave - 24x24x16mm, Short Domed - 24x24x19mm \nLong Concave - 24x24x20mm, Long Domed - 24x24x22mm",

    "rawText": "Product Description\nWireless Controller Compatible With Xbox 360/ Xbox 360 Slim \nHow to Connect to the Xbox 360 Console or PC? \n1. Turn on the console/PC \n2. Install The Battery: \nPut the battery into the battery box (the battery box is marked with the positive and negative poles of the battery), and put it to the On the back of the controller. The 4 lights of the HOME button on the controller will flash quickly. \n3. Insert The Receiver: \nInsert the receiver into the USB port of the console/PC, and the green light of the receiver will flash quickly. \n4. Pairing State: \nBoth the lights of the controller and adapter will flash for 3-5s. Once pairing, the light of the controller and the receiver keeps on (wireless connection); the light of the receiver flashes for 10 seconds and then turns off (wired connection). \nNote: If the controller fails to pair automatically after the above steps are completed, please press and hold the Pairing Button on the controller for 2s; The controller enters the pairing mode, and the light of the HOME button will start to flash rapidly. Once pairing, the light of the controller and the receiver will keep on. \nAbout Connecting More Than 2 Controllers To The Xbox 360 \nA receiver cannot be used for multiple xbox 360 controllers. \nIf you want to connect 4 controllers to the Xbox, you need to ensure that there are 4 usb ports on the Xbox, because one controller must correspond to one adapter. \nIf you want to connect 4pcs xbox 360 wireless controllers to the xbox at the same time, that means you should plug 4 receivers into the Xbox, otherwise the controllers won't be able to complete the connection. \nPrecise D-Pad \nHigh quality 8-way directional pad and two analog pressure-point triggers help you stay in perfect control. \nUpgraded Joysticks \nJust the same as the joystick of the official wireless 360 controller. Spend less money to enjoy the same sensitivity \nOriginal Chip \nEfficiently processes and transmits data, which shortens the controller's response time to each instruction. \nRumble Control - Double Shock \nBuilt-in two 4-piece motors are more durable and provide better rumble experience than other 3rd wireless 360 controller. \nErgonomic Design \nGreat new look with a matte black finish and gloss accents. Award winning compact ergonomics provide a more comfortable gaming experience. \nComfortable To Hold \nGrips and contours have been designed to fit your hands more comfortably, all the buttons and controls make your hand very comfortable for long periods of gameplay. \nReasons for Key or Joystick Drifting or Uncontrolled \nIt may be caused by accidentally touching the button or joystick while installing the battery, which causes the button or joystick to memorize and maintain this position. For example, when installing the battery, if your hand move the left joystick up, after the controller is connected, the joystick will remain up when using. That's why the joystick doesn't listen to commands. \nSolution: \nPlease remove the battery and install it again. When installing the battery, please do not touch any buttons or joysticks. \n\t\n\tS-witch Controller PC/XB 360 Controller P3 Controller XB Battery Pack \n\t\nAdd to Cart \nAdd to Cart \nBuying Options \nBuying Options \nCustomer Reviews \n4.4 out of 5 stars \n3,085 \n\t\n4.3 out of 5 stars \n18,413 \n\t\n— \n\t\n4.6 out of 5 stars \n3,953 \n\t\nPrice $19.99$19.99 \t$16.99$16.99 \t— \t— \t\nCompatible with N-Sw/Lite/OLED, PC Windows 10/8/7 \tXB 360 & Slim/PC Win 10/8/7 \tP3 Console \tXB One/X/S/Elite/Series X|S Controller",

That's why the joystick doesn't listen to commands. \nSolution: \nPlease remove the battery and install it again. When installing the battery, please do not touch any buttons or joysticks.",

What can of application do I need to download to use this controller? A: No application needed. Plug it in and your PC or Respberry Pi will recognize it. \nQ: 2. Work with steam games on pc? A: No, not support steam games. \nQ: 3. Will this work for Tesla Atari games? A: If you're using an Atari emulator on PC or Mac, then it will. \nQ: 4. Can I use it to play online games? A: No, this controller not supports online games. \nQ: 5. Why my controller inputting both joystick and keyboard buttons? A: What emulator are you using? Difficulty on mapping the buttons depends on the emulator. We recommend using SNES9X on PC, OpenEmu on Mac, Retropie on Respberry Pi. \nTips: \n1. Plug in the controller first before open the emulator or power on the raspberry pi, so your device could detect the controller easily. \n2. VirtuaNES is perfect emulator for Windows PC. \n3. RESET the controller before the first use. \nPackage : \n2 x 2.4G Rechargeable Wireless USB Controller \n2 x 2.4 GHz USB Receiver \n2 x USB Charging Cable \n1 x User Manual",

We recommend using SNES9X on PC, OpenEmu on Mac, Retropie on Respberry Pi. \nTips: \n1. Plug in the controller first before open the emulator or power on the raspberry pi, so your device could detect the controller easily. \n2. VirtuaNES is perfect emulator for Windows PC. \n3.

(HallEffect AccuRate Technology) Hall effect technology developed for advanced flight simulation. Achieve unparalleled precision and consistency over time, with movement tracking to within 0.01 degree. \nSay goodbye to mini-stick drift, and enjoy unbelievably-precise performance that won't decrease over time, thanks to Hall effect technology! \nANTI-DRIFT MAGNETIC REVOLUTION \nEndorsed by gamers, H.E.A.R.T. (HallEffect AccuRateTechnology) represents 15 years of Thrustmaster expertise in Hall effect technology applied to flight simulation joysticks. H.E.A.R.T. provides you with unparalleled precision over time, while eliminating drift through ultra-precise magnetic sensors that measure your stick movements. Providing you with optimal control, even after hundreds of hours of gameplay. \nPERFORMANCE THAT DEFIES TIME \nDrift is a common problem where your cursor moves on its own, even when you are no longer touching the stick. On traditional gamepads, the potentiometer technology wears out over time, which leads to a loss of precision and causes drift. With H.E.A.R.T., the position is measured without mechanical friction, eliminating drift completely. As a result, the gamepad keeps its initial precision like the very first day. \nPURE PRECISION \nWith H.E.A.R.T., your sticks capture every movement with surgical precision, within 0.01 degree. You enjoy optimal responsiveness that faithfully reproduces each of your actions. It’s a real game changer, especially for games where precision is essential. You have total control and unerring precision in your movements, even in the most intense situations. \nUNPARALLELED RESPONSIVENESS \nYou will be immediately won over by the exceptional responsiveness of the mechanical buttons, which bests the speed of traditional membrane-based buttons* by 64%. Enjoy greater responsiveness and perform your actions faster than your opponents through a lower activation distance of only 0.3 mm. \nCREATE AND SET YOUR OWN STYLE \nTake control of your HEART CONTROLLER with complete configuration of the settings and central LED colors. With ThrustmapperX software, you can freely customize the sensitivity of the sticks, trigger activation travel, and remap the 2 rear buttons of the gamepad to suit your gaming preferences and style.",

The large 40mm drivers can also produce crisp sound with thumping bass. \nIdeal for Commutes and Travel: Explore more with 40 hours of playtime with ANC on and 60 hours with ANC off. And even if you're in a rush and running low on power, a 5-minute fast charge will give you 4 more hours of peaceful travel. \nsoundcore App: Personalize your listening experience in the soundcore app with a customizable EQ, white noise for relaxation, and more. \nTransparency Mode: Switch to transparency mode to connect with your surroundings without taking your noise cancelling headphones off. If you want some quiet, easily toggle between noise cancelling and normal mode as well. \nDual Device Connectivity: For extra convenience, connect up to two devices at the same time. The noise cancelling headphones will intelligently switch to the device that is playing audio. \nLong Listening Comfort: Multi-angle rotatable ear cups allow you to wear your Bluetooth headphones at any angle. Breathable mesh keeps your ears sweat-free and memory foam cushions adapt to the shape of your ears for long-lasting comfort. \nHands-Free Calls: Incoming call but your hands are full? Just tap the button on your Bluetooth headphones and the built-in microphone will pick up your voice clearly for convenient conversation. \nNote: ANC mode is not compatible with an AUX cable. According to regulations, the maximum volume of headphones should not exceed 100dB. In order to protect your hearing, Q20i's maximum volume has been set to 95dB. It is recommended that you do not listen to excessively loud volumes for long periods of time.",

        "text": "Reduce Noise By Up to 90%: soundcore Q20i noise cancelling headphones use hybrid active noise cancelling technology to effectively block out sounds in real-time. \nHi-Res Audio: Hi-Res audio means that you can listen to wireless music of better quality than a CD. The large 40mm drivers can also produce crisp sound with thumping bass. \nIdeal for Commutes and Travel: Explore more with 40 hours of playtime with ANC on and 60 hours with ANC off. And even if you're in a rush and running low on power, a 5-minute fast charge will give you 4 more hours of peaceful travel. \nsoundcore App: Personalize your listening experience in the soundcore app with a customizable EQ, white noise for relaxation, and more. \nTransparency Mode: Switch to transparency mode to connect with your surroundings without taking your noise cancelling headphones off. If you want some quiet, easily toggle between noise cancelling and normal mode as well. \nDual Device Connectivity: For extra convenience, connect up to two devices at the same time. The noise cancelling headphones will intelligently switch to the device that is playing audio. \nLong Listening Comfort: Multi-angle rotatable ear cups allow you to wear your Bluetooth headphones at any angle. Breathable mesh keeps your ears sweat-free and memory foam cushions adapt to the shape of your ears for long-lasting comfort. \nHands-Free Calls: Incoming call but your hands are full? Just tap the button on your Bluetooth headphones and the built-in microphone will pick up your voice clearly for convenient conversation. \nNote: ANC mode is not compatible with an AUX cable. According to regulations, the maximum volume of headphones should not exceed 100dB. In order to protect your hearing, Q20i's maximum volume has been set to 95dB. It is recommended that you do not listen to excessively loud volumes for long periods of time."

    "Hi-Res Audio: Custom oversized 40 mm dynamic drivers produce Hi-Res sound. Life Q20 active noise canceling headphones reproduce music with extended high frequencies that reach up to 40 kHz for extraordinary clarity and detail.",
    "Reduce Ambient Noises By Up to 90%: Our team of engineers conducted more than 100,000 tests in real-life scenarios to fine-tune Life Q20’s 4 built-in ANC microphones and digital active noise cancellation algorithm. As a result, the hybrid active noise cancellation can detect and cancel out a wider range of low and mid-frequency noises such as cars and airplane engines.",
    "100% Stronger Bass: Our exclusive BassUp technology conducts real-time analysis of the low frequencies to instantly strengthen the bass output. Double press the play button when listening to bass-heavy genres like EDM and hip-hop for an amplified listening experience.",
    "60-Hour Playtime*: Up to 40 hours of non-stop playtime in wireless active noise cancellation mode (at 60% volume) is extended to an enormous 60 hours in standard music mode. A single charge gives you enough juice to listen to over 600 songs or soundtrack multiple long haul flights.

Increase to 60 hours in standard wireless listening mode. \nAUX Cable: Use the included AUX cable for unlimited listening in wired mode. \nBuilt-In Microphone: Make convenient, hands-free calls. \nNote \n1. According to regulations, the maximum volume of headphones should not exceed 100dB. In order to protect your hearing, Life Q20’s maximum volume has been set to around 95dB. It is recommended that you do not listen to excessively loud volumes for long periods of time. \n2. Noise cancellation technology is designed to reduce ambient noise, but it may not completely eliminate all sounds, especially high-frequency sounds like human voices. However, if you find that the noise cancellation feature is not working as expected, please try the following steps to see if there are some differences: \n(1)Please first look at the L/R logo inside the earcovers to ensure that the right and left ears are properly worn. \n(2)Adjust the sliders on the headband arms, make sure the earcovers cover your ear for a secure and sealable fit. \n(3)Try the headphones in another environment. \n3. What to Do If Your Headphones Keep Falling Off：If your headphones are not staying in place, follow these steps: \n(1)Ensure Proper Fit: Verify the ear cups are positioned correctly on your ears. \n(2)Adjust the Headband: Adjust the headband length for a comfortable and secure fit. The ear cups should fully cover your ears without being too tight or loose. \n(3)Manage Long Hair: If you have long hair, tuck it behind your ears to reduce friction that might cause the headphones to slide.",

It is recommended that you do not listen to excessively loud volumes for long periods of time. \n2. Noise cancellation technology is designed to reduce ambient noise, but it may not completely eliminate all sounds, especially high-frequency sounds like human voices. However, if you find that the noise cancellation feature is not working as expected, please try the following steps to see if there are some differences: \n(1)Please first look at the L/R logo inside the earcovers to ensure that the right and left ears are properly worn. \n(2)Adjust the sliders on the headband arms, make sure the earcovers cover your ear for a secure and sealable fit. \n(3)Try the headphones in another environment. \n3. What to Do If Your Headphones Keep Falling Off：If your headphones are not staying in place, follow these steps: \n(1)Ensure Proper Fit: Verify the ear cups are positioned correctly on your ears. \n(2)Adjust the Headband: Adjust the headband length for a comfortable and secure fit. The ear cups should fully cover your ears without being too tight or loose. \n(3)Manage Long Hair: If you have long hair, tuck it behind your ears to reduce friction that might cause the headphones to slide."

  "description": "*Requires smartphone with Android 8.0 or later, 1.5GB or more RAM and Samsung Health app version 6.22 or later. **Available only for running workouts. Requires initial set up of 10 minutes of outside running with GPS on; smartphone with Android 8.0 or later, 1.5GB or more RAM and Samsung Health app version 6.22 or later. ***Phone must be within 2 feet of user with snore detection enabled through Samsung Health app version 6.22 or later. ****Requires Samsung Galaxy Smartphone with Android 7.0 or later, and Samsung Health Monitor app (available only at the Samsung Galaxy app store). The ECG Monitor App intended for adults 22 years and older analyzes pulse rate data to identify episodes of irregular heart rhythms suggestive of AFib and provides a notification suggesting the user record an ECG to analyze the heart rhythm. The IHRN feature is not intended to provide a notification on every episode of irregular rhythm suggestive of AFib and the absence of a notification is not intended to indicate no disease process is present; rather the feature is intended to opportunistically acquire pulse rate data when the user is still and analyze the data when determined sufficient toward surfacing a notification. The ECG Monitor App is not intended to replace traditional methods of diagnosis or treatment. The ECG app is not intended for users with known arrhythmias other than AFib or users under 22 years old. Users should not interpret or take clinical action based on the device output without consultation of a qualified healthcare professional. *****The Samsung BIA is a body analyzer that uses bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) technology to track body composition based on weight, body fat, body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle, body water, and basal metabolic rate (BMR) measurements. It is not intended to specifically diagnose or treat a medical condition. ******Compatibility for Galaxy wearable apps: Android 8.0 or later, 1.5GB of RAM. *******47mm Galaxy Watch6 Classic model only. ********Select interchangeable watch bands sold separately.",

  "description": "Train brilliantly with Forerunner® 965, the premium GPS running and triathlon smartwatch with a bright AMOLED touchscreen display and lightweight titanium bezel. Wake up to your morning report with HRV status to see health insights with an overview of sleep, recovery and training outlook (data presented is intended to be a close estimation of metrics tracked). The training readiness feature tells you when you’re primed for a productive session — while daily suggested workouts adapt to performance and recovery alongside the race widget, which provides training tips, course details and completion time predictions. Navigate any route confidently with multi-band GPS and full-color, built-in maps. With traditional buttons and a touchscreen display, it’s easy to tap into your training status and know whether you’re training productively, peaking or strained. If you’re pushing to outshine the competition, the Forerunner 965 is there to light up every run with up to 23 days of battery life in smartwatch mode.",

  "description": "Lead the pack with Forerunner® 955 Solar, the premium GPS running and triathlon smartwatch with Power Glass™ solar charging to extend battery life. The training readiness feature tells you when you’re primed for a productive session — while daily suggested workouts adapt to your performance and recovery alongside the race widget, which provides training tips, course details and completion time predictions. With morning report, you can get an overview of your sleep, recovery, training and more — as well as a picture of your overall health with heart rate variability (HRV) status (This device is intended to give an estimate of your activity and metrics). On the run, new multi-band GPS and full-color, built-in maps help you navigate confidently. And with traditional buttons and a touch display, it has never been easier to tap into your training status and know whether you’re training productively, peaking or strained. If you’re pushing toward the podium — or to the very limits — Forerunner 955 Solar is by your side with up to 20 days of battery life with solar charging in smartwatch mode (assuming all-day wear with 3 hours per day outside in 50,000 lux conditions).",
  "features": [
    "Built with an always-on, full-color display that’s light on the wrist and easy to read even in direct sunlight",
    "Battery life: up to 20 days of battery life in smartwatch mode for a full picture of your health — from sleep to training (assuming all-day wear with 3 hours per day outside in 50,000 lux conditions); up to 42 hours in GPS mode and up to 49 hours with solar charging (assuming continuous use for entire period in 50,000 lux conditions); up to 110 hours in UltraTrac mode with solar charging (assuming use in 50,000 lux conditions)",
    "Click or swipe through maps and stats with traditional button controls or a new, responsive touchscreen",
    "Whether you’re running on city streets or riding densely covered trails, Forerunner 955 provides full-color, built-in mapping to keep you on track",
    "Access multiple global navigation satellite systems, and get access to multiple frequencies sent by navigation satellites for improved accuracy in areas where GNSS signals are reflected, weak or typically don't penetrate — giving you superior accuracy for how far and how fast you’ve run — even in challenging environments",
    "From the moment you wake up, get a training readiness score based on your sleep quality, recovery, training and more, so you can determine whether it’s a good day to go hard — or take it easy",
    "Get ready for your next race with race widget — which provides training tips, personalized daily suggested workouts and completion time predictions based on course details, weather and performance",
    "Using new indicators such as HRV status, your recent exercise history and performance, get an easy insight into your overall effort with training status — and know whether you’re training productively, peaking or strained",
    "Receive an overview of your sleep, recovery and training outlook as soon as you wake up with morning report — alongside HRV status, training readiness and weather; you can even customize your report to show what you want to see (This device is intended to give an estimate of your activity and metrics)",
    "With HRV status, gain a deeper understanding of your overall health, recovery and training performance through heart rate variability while you sleep, based on technology developed by our Firstbeat Analytics team (This device is intended to give an estimate of your activity and metrics)"

If you walking less than 20 steps in a period, the step counter would not count. (To reduce the wrong count when you working and sleeping)",

Please check that you have provided accurate information about gender, age, height, and weight when setting up the Fitomo app. Wrong information will affect the calculation of the acceleration sensor and can result in inaccurate step counts, distance data, calories burned, and overall personal exercise data. \n2. Please test whether raising the wrist to activate the screen is functional. \n3. If the above reasons are ruled out, and the error of the exercise pedometer is more than 5% or the error of the daily life pedometer is more than 10%, then it may be the fault of the acceleration sensor. Please con tact us for help. \n4. Please note if the body frequently moves during sleep (such as often sleep turning or getting up), or is on a bumpy road surface, it is possible to generate step data. \nNOTE: DO NOT DOWNLOAD the incorrect User Manual and Troubleshooting Guide that comes with the \"product guides and documents\" on this page as it is the wrong version. We are unable to update it due to Amazon system limitations. If you need the user manual, please con tact us for assistance!",

Please check that you have provided accurate information about gender, age, height, and weight when setting up the Fitomo app. Wrong information will affect the calculation of the acceleration sensor and can result in inaccurate step counts, distance data, calories burned, and overall personal exercise data. \n2. Please test whether raising the wrist to activate the screen is functional. \n3. If the above reasons are ruled out, and the error of the exercise pedometer is more than 5% or the error of the daily life pedometer is more than 10%, then it may be the fault of the acceleration sensor. Please con tact us for help. \n4. Please note if the body frequently moves during sleep (such as often sleep turning or getting up), or is on a bumpy road surface, it is possible to generate step data. \nNOTE: DO NOT DOWNLOAD the incorrect User Manual and Troubleshooting Guide that comes with the \"product guides and documents\" on this page as it is the wrong version. We are unable to update it due to Amazon system limitations. If you need the user manual, please con tact us for assistance!"

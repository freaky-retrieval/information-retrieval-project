This surround sound system for TV is equipped with Dolby Atmos, which separates music, dialogue, and effects, and places them in different parts of a room for a truly immersive spatial audio experience like you’ve never heard it before.

Even old school movies, tv shows, and games sound new again with this Bluetooth soundbar for TV. Having a hard time hearing what your favorite characters are saying? A.I. Dialogue Mode balances voice and surround sound for ultra-crisp vocal clarity. With six full-range transducers, including two custom-engineered upward firing dipole speakers, you’ll feel like your space is filled with sound from every direction, even overhead, with this TV speaker. But it’s not just the sound quality you’ll love. Premium materials. Solid construction. Refined finishes. Clever controls. All carefully considered to create a Dolby Atmos soundbar surround sound system that looks as beautiful as it sounds. Amazon Alexa is built in, so just say the word. Or connect the Bluetooth soundbar to a compatible Google device so you can control your content just using your voice. Connect to your TV with either included cable, an optical audio cable or an HDMI eARC cable. Use Bose SimpleSync to connect with different Bose headphones and select Bose Bluetooth speakers.",

  "description": "The Bose TV Speaker helps you hear your TV better. It’s a small sound bar that clarifies speech and improves overall TV sound. Inside the TV speaker there are two full-range drivers angled to deliver wide, spacious sound and a center tweeter specifically focused on elevating vocals. Built-in Dolby decoding helps further enhance this compact TV speaker’s audio capabilities to deliver a more realistic and satisfying listening experience. Designed with simplicity in mind, this small soundbar only uses a single connection to the TV via an optical audio cable (included) or an HDMI cable (sold separately) and has you up and running in minutes. At just over 2\" tall, the Bose TV Speaker is a compact sound bar that can be placed just about anywhere. And small LED lights on the front of this small soundbar turn on and/or change color for visual confirmation when certain features are enabled. They also blink in acknowledgement of volume changes. The Bose TV Speaker has HDMI-CEC, which allows the TV and this small soundbar to communicate when connected with an HDMI cable. Meaning when you turn the TV on, the TV speaker will automatically turn on too. With this technology, you can even keep using your current TV remote to control the volume of this compact soundbar. However, the Bose TV Speaker comes with its own remote. And on it, you can enable “dialogue mode” on the TV speaker to elevate vocals even more or press the “bass” button for some extra depth. This compact soundbar also is a Bluetooth soundbar. Simply press the Bluetooth button on the remote to pair your device to this Bluetooth TV speaker and wirelessly stream your favorite music or podcasts. You can also expand your system at any time by adding a wired subwoofer to the Bluetooth TV speaker for a more home-theater-like experience. The Bose TV Speaker is compatible with the Bose Bass Module 500 and 700 and requires the Bose Bass Module Connection Cable or a standard 3.5 mm audio cable, sold separately.",

However, some have mixed opinions on connection speed, functionality, quality, and the remote control.",

  "description": "Product DescriptionDefinitive has always LED the industry with the best-sounding shielded center channels available. Optimum surround sound home theater reproduction places heavy demands on the center channel speaker, which in many respects is the main speaker in the system and often handles 50% or more of the program material. It is no place to compromise and settle for second best. Because of this, definitive pioneered the concept of full frequency range high-definition center-channel speakers. Definitive's center channels and C/L/RS are consistently rated as the best available, and have won numerous audio video Grand Prix center channel of the year Awards each and every year.From the Manufacturer The ProCenter 1000 is Definitive's mid-sized center speaker in the acclaimed ProCinema Series. A ProCenter 1000 along with four ProCenter 800s or ProMonitor 1000s and a matching ProSub makes a complete ProCinema system. All the components of the system are packed and sold separately allowing you to mix and match Pro Series components to build the system that best suits your needs.  Enjoy warm, life-like sound from a small center channel speaker High-definition Balanced Double Surround System technology drivers (available in black or white) Built-in foot allows for perfect angle adjustment. View larger  Don't let the ProCenter 1000's small size and affordable price fool you -- it is a remarkably sophisticated product with huge sound. The 1000 incorporates many of the same technologies as Definitive's top-of-the-line models including BDSS drivers, pure aluminum dome tweeters, and planar pressure coupled mid/bass radiators for home theater sound quality that will astound you.  Bass radiators enhance low frequency performance for more true-to-life sound  The Secret to Its Big SoundCompeting center channel speakers of this size usually have weak lower-midrange response; that part of the audio range that contains the \"warmth\" and \"body\" of voices and musical instruments. Listen to a male vocal on typical small satellite speakers and you will instantly hear the weakness in the lower midrange. The ProCenter avoids this critical problem by pressure-coupling exclusive BDSS technology drivers to two equal-sized mid/bass radiators cleverly placed on the sides of the speaker. This technique doubles the lower-midrange/bass radiating area of the speaker without increasing the size of the enclosure. You’ll enjoy the kind of rich, warm and life-like sound quality that you thought was only possible with big, hard-to-place speakers. Center Channel MuscleAs much as 75% of a movie's soundtrack is played by the center channel loudspeaker making it arguably the most important speaker in a home theater system. It is the key to getting intelligible dialog and true-to-life sound effects. So we lavished extra attention on the ProCenter 1000. It features 2 of the same BDSS drivers as used in ProMonitor 800 satellites along with 2 mid/bass radiators on the sides of the enclosure, allowing it to play loud and clear with high tonal accuracy.Easy to Place, Easy to UseSmall enough to disappear in a room but beautiful when in plain view, the ProCenter 1000 can be mounted on a shelf or on top of a TV. Its built-in foot allows you to adjust the angle of the speaker in the vertical plane to aim the speaker at listener’s ear height. Or you can wall mount it using two optional ProMount 80 articulating wall mounts (sold separately).The SoundThe ProCenter 1000 is a revelation in terms of achieving incredible sound at an affordable price. It fulfills with aplomb its most important job of delivering perfectly clear and intelligible dialog to every listener in the room. It dishes out high impact sound effects with distortion-free dynamics but is also capable of great subtlety to excel equally with music or movies.Technical SpecificationsDimensions: 14.75 by 5 by 5 inches (W x H x D)Dimensions: 14.75 by 5 by 5 inches (W x H x D)Nominal impedance: 4 to 8 ohmsNominal impedance: 4 to 8 ohmsFrequency response: 47 Hz to 30 kHzFrequency response: 47 Hz to 30 kHzRecommended amplification: 10 to 200 wattsRecommended amplification: 10 to 200 wattsEfficiency: 90 dBEfficiency: 90 dBDriver complement: 2 x 4.5\" bass/midrange drivers; 2 x 4.5\" planar low-frequency radiators; 1 x 1\" aluminum dome tweeterDriver complement: 2 x 4.5\" bass/midrange drivers; 2 x 4.5\" planar low-frequency radiators; 1 x 1\" aluminum dome tweeterMagnetic shielding: YesMagnetic shielding: YesFinish: Gloss blackFinish: Gloss black",

        "text": "Q: Is it compatible with TV/TV-Box/Projector/Monitor/Xbox/PStation/iPad/tablets? \nA: No. This USB speaker can only be used for computers. The reason for this is that the USB ports on other devices may not provide sufficient electric power to drive our speaker, resulting in a reduced maximum volume level. \nQ: Is it okay if I connect it to a USB hub? \nA: The USB-hub is not recommended as it may not provide enough power to drive our speaker, resulting in potential audio issues such as distortion, cluttered sound, or even constant pops (audio cut-out) when played at high volume. \nQ: Is there a mic built-in? \nA: The device does not have a built-in microphone, so it is recommended to use an external computer microphone for video calls. \nQ: How to adjust speaker volume? \nA: You can simply adjust the volume on your computer system. \nQ: Can this speaker be used without attaching to monitor? \nA: Yes of course, the clamp also allows the speaker to be placed smoothly on your desk.",

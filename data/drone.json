    "Robust Brushless Motor Better Performance - Built in with a robust brushless motor, it provides the drone for adults with extraordinary performance in speed and power. Unlike a brushed motor, our drone for kids has features of longer life, less noise, and steadier performance. Flying our mini drones guarantees an amazing experience.",
    "Capture 4K Pictures From Many Angles - Our FPV drone is equipped with a 90-degree adjustable HD camera that provides various benefits like high-resolution images, and captures sceneries from many angles. Mini drone with camera adopts 5G real-time transmission techniques that ensure fluent and uninterrupted transmission, even when kids drone at far distances, in high-speed flying, and under strong wind.",
    "Optical Flow Positioning Sensor - An extra camera is attached to the bottom of the drone for kids 8-12, allowing you to capture some unexpected images. Aided by the optical flow positioning sensor, it greatly stabilizes the drone with camera for adults at a fixed height for taking clearer pictures easily.",
    "Extend a Longer Flying Adventure - Our drone with camera comes with two batteries, which greatly extends the flight time up to 28mins. Moreover, beginner-friendly functions of drone for kids 12-14, such as 3-speed level shifts, 3D flips, headless mode, one click to take off/land, gesture control, and gravity sensing facilitate beginners to start their first flight easily.",
    "Useful Tips Before Flight - Please always calibrate the gyro when turning on the drone with camera for kids every time, even after the drone crashes. All you need to do is pull down both joysticks on the left and right at 45 degrees at the same time until the drone for kids 4-6 stops flashing. The 2secs calibration greatly enhances the stable performance of the drone for kids 6-8. For any issues with our product, please reach out to our support team for a refund or exchange."

  "description": "Overview3 cameras support focus following.Support Cruise Control, Waypoint Flight, and other functions.Notes1. ActiveTrack is unavailable at video resolutions higher than 4K or frame rates over 60fps.2. Flight Time was measured with Mavic 3 Pro flying at a constant speed of 32.4 kph in a windless environment at sea level until the battery level reached 0%. Data is for reference only. Please pay attention to RTH reminders in the DJI Fly app during your flight.3. DO NOT use the aircraft in severe weather conditions, including heavy wind exceeding 13.8 m/s, snow, rain, fog, hail, or lightning. DO NOT fly the aircraft 6000 m (19685 ft.) or higher above sea level. DO NOT fly the aircraft in environments where the temperature is below -10° C (14° F) or above 40° C (104° F). DO NOT take off from moving objects such as cars or boats. DO NOT fly close to reflective surfaces such as water or snow. Otherwise, the vision system may not work correctly. When the GNSS signal is weak, fly the aircraft in environments with good lighting and visibility. Low ambient light may cause the vision system to function abnormally. DO NOT fly near areas with magnetic or radio interference. Familiar magnetic or radio interference sources include Wi-Fi hotspots, routers, Bluetooth devices, high-voltage lines, large-scale power transmission stations, radar stations, mobile base stations, and broadcasting towers. Avoid sand entering the aircraft when taking off in desert or beach areas. Fly the aircraft in open areas away from crowds. Buildings, mountains, and trees may block the GNSS signal and affect the onboard compass.4. Measured in an outdoor, open environment, without interference, and with FCC compliance. The above data shows the farthest communication range for one-way, non-return flights. Please pay attention to RTH reminders in the DJI Fly app during your flight.",

    "4K UHD Camera with Image Stabilization: The optimized full HD Camera built with Shock Absorption holder ensures shooting 3840 x 2160 high-resolution images and videos without camera vibration. 5GHz FPV transmission and 90°adjustable lens enable you to see the world from different angles.",
    "GPS Assisted Intelligent Flight: Never lose the drone. It returns automatically whenever battery is low, signal is lost or you press one key return. Also, it is so smart to fly at your will, following you automatically, flying along a path you set, or fly around a point in circles. You may focus on your photography and creation.",
    "Configuration Upgrade: The 2 intelligent batteries works for 26 Mins/per battery for each charge; 52 Mins in total with 2 batteries; the long-life Brushless Motors have lower power consumption and give you a quieter flight; the foldable design and well-fitted carrying case make it easy to take the drone outdoor. DON'T use batteries from other brands, which may cause product issue or safety concern! PRODUCT SUPPORT AVAILABLE!",
    "Simple Operation: Equipped Multi Sensors guarantee hovering with great stability and high quality pics taken under different flying environment; Optical Flow Positioning makes great effect when GPS signal is lost or weak. Functions, like one key start/stop, emergency stop, altitude hold and electric fence, keep it simple to control for even beginners.",
    "Considerate Controller: The control range of 2.4GHz transmitter reaches to 3000 feet high range; battery level and GPS signal shown on the LED screen; a button to turn on or off the drone light is added; right hand throttle mode is available for left-hander. Remember to remove the scratch-proof film from the controller and the camera before use."

    "【FAA Compliance】Ruko U11S drone complies with the FAA Declaration of Compliance, which you can check on the FAA website and will not affect the normal use of the drone. If you have any questions about FAA Remote ID, please feel free to contact the Ruko Customer Support team for assistance.",
    "【Ideal Choice For Your First Flight】It's an entry-level drone with all the basic features that beginners can easily use. Just enjoy playing interactive games with your family and create more precious memories freely.",
    "【90° Adjustable & 4K UHD Camera】90° adjustable 4K camera providing a broader vision, enable to capture perfect UHD pictures and save to your phone directly to better record your precious moments.",
    "【Fly Indoors & Outdoors】[Optical flow positioning] provides you a safer indoor flight while [GPS positioning] gives a more free and stabilized outdoor flight. They also help the drone lock the height precisely and hover stably to take better photos or videos.",
    "【Extend Your Flight Time】An intelligent battery provides a maximum flight time of 20 minutes. An extra battery extends the flight time to 40 mins (2*20 mins), doubles your practice time!",
    "【Beginners Friendly Transmitter】The transmitter can be charged directly, which saves you more time by not having to replace the battery like others. The one-key functions on it are also super easy to operate.",
    "【Perfect Travel Companion】The camera drone can be folded to carry, and its size like a mobile phone makes it lighter and safer than many others. You can take it to anywhere and record all the wonderful moments.",
    "【Considerate Customer Service】Ruko promises a 30 day return and 90 day free warranty. If you have any questions about our products, such as the operation of drones, please feel free to contact us.",
    "【Usage Tips】1. WiFi appears only after the drone and remote controller are linked. It is recommended to finish the connection between the phone and WiFi before entering the RUKO GPS APP. 2. If in an environment with many WiFi, it may be difficult to refresh. 3. If WiFi is disconnected, you can turn on the flight mode of the phone and turn off the VPN. 4. If WiFi is disconnected, it may be caused by surrounding signal interference or obstacles blocking the signal (it is normal to disconnect WiFi signal when flying far and in a complex environment). It is recommended to choose an open environment to fly the drone."

I'm sure you can take some interesting photos & videos, or even use it to inspect the roof of a house or other hard-to-reach areas. Friends can shoot each other skating & capture really cool videos.",
    "Play Longer: The FPV drone has two rechargeable batteries, each providing approximately 12 minutes of flight time. 2 batteries can be swapped & charged in rotation, greatly extending the fun time. Note that more flips & faster speeds will reduce the flight time per battery.",
    "Remote Control & App: You can fly the mini drone with remote control or a smart phone. But in order to capture video or images, you must be connected to the drone via WiFi & the ''Hiturbo FPV'' app. If you need to use the voice control, trajectory flight & other functions which under the ''control switch'' button in the app, you need to disconnect the remote control from the drone, connect the drone with the app individually.",
    "Discover new adventures: 2 batteries provide you with up to 24 minutes of flying experience. Features such as altitude hold, 3D flip, headless mode, one key take off/landing, speed adjustment & voice control make it easy & fun for beginners or novices.",
    "Suitable for Adults & Kids: This drone is a little easier to operate than other drones (it has fewer steps to fly, no manual pairing required), so it's suitable for people just starting out. If you're considering learning how to fly a drone, make this drone your first one. You'll be surprised at how easy it is to take your imagination to the next level with this starter drone",
    "Helpful Tips: Make sure to calibrate the gyroscope every time the drone is turned on (and after a crash). Simply hold both joysticks in the lower right or lower left 45° position until the drone stops flashing, the whole process take only 2 seconds. We found it very helpful for drone control & stability."
